## To Be Improved in Future ðŸš€

### Backend Enhancements

- **Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Refactor the backend to split data structures into reusable models.
- **Move hardcoded API URLs to `env.js`:** Use environment variables for different development and production environments.
- **Replace hardcoded database credentials:** Use `.env` or `config.js` for better security and flexibility.
- **Implement better error handling:** Add middleware for centralized error handling.
- **Use a structured logging system:** Implement a logging framework like Winston or Morgan.

### Frontend Enhancements

- **Improve state management:** Consider using Vuex or Pinia for better state handling.
- **Enhance UI/UX:** Implement better design components and animations.
- **Optimize performance:** Lazy load components and minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- **Implement unit and integration testing:** Use Jest for testing frontend components.

### Deployment & Scaling

- **Containerize the application:** Use Docker for easier deployment.
- **Set up CI/CD pipelines:** Automate testing and deployment.
- **Improve database indexing:** Optimize queries for better performance.
- **Implement authentication and authorization:** Add role-based access control (RBAC).
